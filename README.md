# Introduction 

In GIT a GIST is a short bit of code, notes or snippet.

This SQL repository includes a range of SQL gists to use with Oracle SQL Server.

# How to use and contribute

1. Open Oracle SQL Developer
2. Clone the VSTS *SQL_Gists* repository to your local P: drive.
3. Open an existing text file to view example code. Select the line and run code after adding in variables in {}.
4. Alternately, create a new worksheet with generic code and save to your local repository.
5. Add the changes made, commit the work and push to master when the work is finished.

# Troubleshooting

1. If you can't see the repository in your SQL Developer Version Pane then initialize a local repository in your %AppData% directory. The default is project. Once you do this the SQL_Gists repo appears as well.
2. If you use GIT for Windows to update a repo currently being used by SQL Developer it will create a branch that will need to be merged.
